           <h2>Language Skills</h2>

           <p> Since I was born in cities of Iranian Torky speakers, sweet <b>Azari</b> is my Mother tongue. Also, my second lanuage is <b>Persian</b> because since Iran is the country of diffrent culturs with diffrent languages as a unite nation we use Persian as own official language in books and official places. For that reasons, the Persian is my second language.</p>
           <p> Also, I have <b>TOEFL iBT</b> with overall score 74, so I can easily read, listen, speak, and write in english without any concern and I am sure that I am improving my English language each time of doing research and anythings that I am dealing with English.</p>
           <p> <b>Turkish</b> is the another language that I can understand 90 precent of what I am hearing and read Turkish text with mediume speed and writing as much as possible in a write way. I am improving my Turkish language in my free times by searching on youtubs and reading poem books(which I love them so much). </p>
           <p>If I want to describe brifly my language skills I can say that:</p>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   <b>Azari:</b> Mother Tongue
               </li>
               <li>
                   <b>Persian:</b> Official Language
               </li>
               <li>
                   <b>Turkish:</b> Basics
               </li>
               <li>
                   <b>English:</b> TOEFL iBT ( overall score: 74)
