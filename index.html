                <span class="drop-cap">I</span> am Hamed Babaei Giglou. I was born in Isalm Abad No-3 village(a little village with chipest and slowest internet connection) in one of the little north cities of Iran under Ardabil province called Parsabad. I studied the school in a little school near by village untill highschool. Then I moved to city to continue my education in Mathematics and Pyscics field in Borhan examplary school of Parsabad. Since, I used the Borhan dormitory and because my background was so week I made progress by gettng help from other students in dormitories and I really got better underestanding of math in those years. Also, I got interesed in computer fields and the areas of their works like hacking or other dreamy stuffs. Because of that staffs which I am very happy about them, I entered to Computer Science B.Sc. program at University of Mohaghegh Ardabili in 2014 and I got this field very very interesting more than my imagination. I graduated from this university at 2019.
